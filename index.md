## About the Kubernetes Top 10
When adopting [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), we introduce new risks to our applications and infrastructure. The The *OWASP Kubernetes Top 10* is aimed at helping security practitioners, system administrators, and software developers prioritize risks around the Kubernetes ecosystem. The Top Ten is a prioritized list of these risks backed by data collected from organizations varying in maturity and complexity. 

## Getting Involved
Development, issues, and discussion all take place on the OWASP Top Ten [Github](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-kubernetes-top-ten) repository. Join the conversation!
