## Overview

The security context of a workload in Kubernetes is highly configurable which can lead to serious security misconfigurations propagating across and organizationâ€™s workloads and clusters. The 2021 Kubernetes Security Survey from Redhat stated that nearly 60% of respondents have experienced a misconfiguration incident in their Kubernetes environments in the last 12 months.

## Description

Kubernetes manifests contain many different configurations that can effect the reliability, security, and scalability of a given workload. These configurations should be audited and remediated continuously. Some examples of high-impact manifest configurations are below:

**Application processes should not run as root:** 

**Read-only filesystems should be used:**

**Privileged containers should be disallowed**: Setting a container to `privileged` within Kubernetes, the container itself can access additional resources and kernel capabilities of the host itself. Privileged containers are dangerous as they remove many of the built-in container isolation mechanisms entirely. 

**The host network and process space should not be used:**

## How to Prevent

Maintaining secure configurations throughout a large, distributed Kubernetes environment can be a difficult task. Security configurations are typically set in the security context of the manifest itself. See below for an example: 

## Example Attack Scenarios

Example #1: Container Breakout 1-Liner

Example #2: Docker Socket Mount
